### oop (object oriented programming)

1. use drawio (https://www.draw.io/) and create "building blocks" with concepts for the following topics

        git

2. read about UML 2 (unified modeling language)

   https://sparxsystems.com/resources/tutorials/uml2/class-diagram.html

3. create a UML class diagram for each of the following concepts:

        inheritance (IS-A)
        aggregation (HAS-A) 
        composition (HAS-A) restrictive
        association
        
        encapsulation
        abstract classes
        interfaces
        polymorphism

4. write code to prove the concepts in the UML diagrams using the guidelines:

- use encapsulation (private fields, getters + setters)
- use inheritance (create at least 2 levels of inheritance, eg: Grandparent, Parent, Child)
- use aggregation (use an object inside another object)
- use default constructor and constructor with multiple parameters
- use "this" keyword in methods
- use "super" keyword in constructor and methods
- extract common methods in an abstract class (extend it with at least 2 classes)
- define an interface (implement it in at least 2 classes)
- create a class that extends an abstract class and implements 2 interfaces
- prove polymorphism using an abstract class and two implementations

### exceptions

- write code using try-catch-finally
- write multiple catches
- write catch with multiple parameter types
- throw an exception
- use throws in a method signature and call that method
- write a custom exception and throw it

solve ex 1, 2 / pag 51 (sda slides)

### generic types

- write a generic class that can take any type of object (set an object using constructor or setter)
- write a generic class with a restrictive type
- compare two objects using Comparable
- solve ex 1, 2 / pag 61 (sda slides)

## collections

- create a diagram with the collections hierarchy
- use as many operations as possible with the following collections
  (consider CRUD create, read, update, delete)

### list

- transform a list to an array
- iterate using all methods:

        iterator
        for
        enhanced for

- solve ex 1, 2, 3 / pag 68 (sda slides)

### set

- iterate set
- solve ex 1, 2, 3 / pag 71 (sda slides)

### map

- iterate a map
- get the keys from a map
- get the values from a map
- solve ex 1 / pag 74 (sda slides)

### functional interfaces

### lambda

- write a consumer
- write a bi-consumer
- write a supplier
- write a predicate

### streams

- add to DemoStreams:

        compute the sum of ages of all female authors younger than 25
